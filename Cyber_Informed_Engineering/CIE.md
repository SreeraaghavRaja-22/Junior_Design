# Cyber-Informed Engineering

## CIA vs. SRP Triad

### CIA (Traditional IT Focus)

- Confidentiality (C): Prevent unauthorized data access
- Integrity (I): Ensure data is accurate and untampered
- Availability (A): Ensure data/systems are accessible when needed

### SRP (Engineering/CIE Focus)

- Safety (S): Don't harm ppl
- Reliability (R): Ensure system functions as inteded even under stress
- Productivity (P): maintain operation level and performance

### Differences

- CIA protects information while SRP protects physical systems
- CIE bridges the gap between CIA and SRP and improves SRP to protect against cyber attacks

## What is Critical Infrastructure/System?

- Systems so vital to the US that harming them would affect the country overall
- Examples:
  - Energy
  - Water
  - Transportation
  - Healthcare and Public Health
  - Communications
  
## Cyber Attacks on Critical Infrastructure

- Growing in number and affects major Florida cities

### Famous Attacks

- Colonial Pipeline Shutdown
- Nord Stream Pipeline Attack

## National CIE Strategy

- Provides an outline for engineers to prevent cyber attacks
  - Introduced in 2020
  
## Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE)

- uses design decisions and engineering controls
- uses engineering to eliminate harmful consequencies
- Focused on engineers and technicians
- Create a culture of security

### Applicable Throughout Lifecycle

- 1: OT Cybersecurity risk mitgations applied in the testing stage of life cycle
- 2: Requirements are more efficient when applied early on
- Use engineering to mitigate and eliminate the harm of cyber attacks at throughout the life cycle of a design

### CIE Principles

#### Consequence-Focused Design

- How do I understand what critical functions my system must ensure and the undesired consequences it must prevent
- Traffic-Light should prevent collisions

#### Engineering Controls

- How do I implement controls to reduce avenues for attack or the damage which could result?
- Ex: Room Lock
  - Problem: Keys are easier to replicate for hotel doors
  - Solution: Use a keycard
    - Issues: anyone with a keycard that can implement the same signal as you can unlock the door
      - Solution: use a secondary lock system
- **Ideal Engineering Control**: relies on phyics rather than hardware
  - Ex: Sprinkler system
    - sprinkler systems in hotels automatically activate in reponse to heat generated by a fire rather than smoke
      - Impossible for a hacker to turn it on
- Engineering Control Families:
  - Restrict (prevention) - remove the avenuue for attack
  - Recognize (indication) - monitor for incident occurrence
  - Resist (resistance) - methods to limit incident's ability to degrade performance
  - Redirect (response) - more corrective actions than resistance to prevent further degradation
  - Restore (recovery) - recovery from attack to return system to normal operation
  - Reconfigure (adapt) - restructure or adapt future resilient responses to reduce or eliminate the original impact

#### Secure Information Architecture

- How do I prevent undesired manipulation of important data?
  - Connects Cyber and IT staff with engineers
  - Need to understand which cyber systems are the most important control rather than everything
  - Traffic light:
    - make it impossible for attackers en route from the central control system to the traffic light controller without being detected

### Design Simplification

- How do I determine what features of my system are not absolutely necessary to achieve critical functions?
- "Complexity is the enemy of security"
  - attackers can manipulate more things in a complex design vs. a simple design
- Traffic Light:
  - Controller can be implement in 2 ways
    - Bare-Metal System: crafting code that directly interfaces with the hardware without needing an OS
    - RTOS: places a layer of abstraction over hardware
      - manage tasks with a scheduler
      - easier to implement
    - Bare-metal is simpler and safer because it has less holes to puncture through
  
#### Layered Defenses

    - How do I create the best compilation of system defenses?
    - Multi-layered defense so there are multiple defenses against the attacker
  
#### Active Defense

    - How do I proactively prepare to defend my system from any threat?

#### Interdependency Evaluation

    - We have added a new interdependency - the cloud service and software
    - How will instability affect operations?

#### Cyber-Secure Supply Chain Controls

- How do I ensure my providers deliver the security the system needs
- Supply-Chain Security
  - A system's components and security don't just rely on developer but the entire network of organizations
  - **A system is only as secure as its weakest link**

#### Planned Resilience

- How do I turn "what ifs" into "even ifs"?
- Escalators can break but they can still serve as stairs!
- Traffic Light Controller:
  - conflict monitor needs a safe state which is the **blinking red state**
    - traffic will be slower, but it will remain safe

#### Engineering Information Control

- How do I manage knowledge about my system? How do I keep it out of the wrong hands?
- keep information confidential especially if it is a vital system
  - have to keep hackers from getting it

#### Organizational Culture

- How do I ensure that everyone's behavior and decisions align with our security goals?
  - keep communication between teams clean
  - make everyone aware of and understand their role in maintaining the safety of the system

## CIE Example: Traffic Light System

### Traffic Light Control

- Controlled through a combination of local controllers, sensors, and centralized system (possibly)
- **Controllers:** run pre-programmed timing sequences
- **Sensors and Actuators:** inductive loop sensors for car direction, radar or microwave sensors for pedestrians, and push-buttons for the pedestrians too
- **Centralized or Remote Control:** Remotely monitor intersection status, override local control during emergencies or events, optimize timing based on live connected data
  - these systems use cell lines, RF, ethernet, or wifi to control the local lights

#### Solution Review

- **IT Perspective**
  - Centralize Control System Software has a qualifying secure development lifecycle
    - software is steadily developed (which is very good)
  - Cloud provider is reputable and qualified (safe)
- **Engineering Perspective**
  - Centralized system could have a flaw that could exploited by a hacker
  - Manager of the system could be lazy with passwords or susceptible to social attacks
  - Could lead to serious issues
  - **Cheap Solution:**
    - Conflict monitor: embed local, physical control failsafe that defautls to safe state when simulataneous green lights are issued remotely
  
## PCB Hacking Article

### Issues

- Global outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing has made it easier to hack into PCBs
  - Lowered Manufacturing Costs
  - Shortened time-to-market

### Introduction

- Hardware perceived as **secure**
- Hardware vs. Software Attacks
  - Hardware is much harder to fix than software especially after it is deployed

### Big Hack Incident

- What Happened?
  - The security of motherboards at Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) was compromised
    - Had a small chip that injected malware to other motherboards every time the server booted up
    - Allowed Chinese Spies to hack into at least 30 US companies

- Why attack Elemental and Supermicro?
  - Elemental was fast growing and Amazon and the CIA were working with it.
  - Supermicro was a fast growing company and its motherboards were manufactured by contractors in China
- Both were ideal targets for hackers

### Analyzing Big Hack

#### Attacker's Perspective

- Target for Attack: chose companies that were able to cripple a government if they were hacked
- Gaining a Design Understanding:
  - Interdiction: manipulating devices as they are in transit from manufacturer to customer
  - Seeding Attacks: manipulating devices more upstream in supply chain
    - can grant hackers more widespread control
  - Execution of the Infiltration:
    - Supermicro had a backlog of orders, so hired differents subcontractors
      - Impersonated Supermicro officials ordered the malicious chips to be added to the board design
      - Chips had 2 tasks
        - command the motherboard to communicate with external, anonymous computers
        - prepare the device's OS to accept new code from those external computers

#### Investigator's Perspective

- Amazon helped a bunch with the investigation
  - suspicious of Elemental's video compression technology and did a security check
  - Found an issue with Elemental's servers and filed a report
- Apple was very confidential with the suspicious chips found with their hardware too, so the government doesn't know much
- FBI and other teams found the issue and what the chips did and issued a warning to Supermicro customers

#### Social Impacts

- Apple cut ties with Supermicro in the following  year
- Supermicro kept denying the claims and more evidence piled up
  - eventually delisted from NASDAQ
- Big example of how supply chain vulnerabilities can lead to huge issues

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

- The constant competition has made the PCB lifecycle much faster and more outsourced
  - Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have lost control over the PCB lifecycle

### What Other Attacks Were Possible?

- Tradeoff between cost and security
  - have to optimize for this
  - Big Hack revealed vulnerabilities in many of the top companies in the world
  - need for developments in hardware assurance

#### Other Attacks

- Hondata Clone
- Cisco Systems Clone
- Joint Test Access Group (JTAG) has been repeated exploited for access to the PCB's internal features

#### Emerging Attacks

- Hardware Trojan
  - Kill Switch: can cause denial of service
  - Infiltrate Communcation Lines: can corrupt or delay signals
- Piracy or Counterfeiting
  - Cloning PCBs can be really bad especially if it can bankrupt honest companies
